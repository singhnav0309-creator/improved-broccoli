# Calculate the factorial using a Function

Here,We are performing this function with the help of Recursion.
We defined a function named fact_rec 
passed an arguement as a num(integer)
Then,We start a base loop
By putting, if num == 1
that returns 1
else, start a recursion loop 
By passing a num greater than 1 to be factorial
Factorial = num * fact_rec(num -1)
it returns a Factorial
For example, if num = 2
it returns Factorial of 2 is 2.

if num = 3
it returns Factorial of 3 is 6.

if num = 4
it returns Factorial of 4 is 12.

if num = 5
it returns Factorial of 5 is 120.

# By using a math module perform a Calculations

Import a math module for perfoming a Calculations
Then, from math module we perform square root(sqrt), Logarithm(log base e), Sine(in radians).
User give any number as a input.
math.sqrt(number) for square root
it prints, square root of input number

math.log(number) for Logarithm
it prints, Logarithm of input number

math.sin(number)for Sine
it prints, Sine of input number

For example, number = 5
square root: 2.23606797749979
Logarithm: 1.6094379124341003
Sine: -0.9589242746631385
